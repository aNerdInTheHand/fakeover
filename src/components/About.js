    You are the tyrannical sweatshop billionaire owner of a football team.
    Each day you'll face a new dilemma.
    Make decisions to benefit only yourself!
    Score points by:
    <div>
      <ul>
        <li>increasing your personal wealth by leeching as much money out of the club as possible</li>
        <li>reducing fan happiness as much as possible and as frequently as possible</li>
        <li>keeping the team as close to 17th in the table as possible without dropping into the bottom three</li>
        <li>keeping pundit opinion of yourself higher than fan happiness.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <div>
      The game will be over if:
      <ul>
        <li>fan happiness is too high for too long or reaches 0</li>
        <li>the club funds or your personal value hit Â£0</li>
        <li>the club is relegated (finishes below 17th).</li>
